### Welcome to MapGallery!

[MapGallery](http://mapgallery.info) is a straightforward solution for interactive maps and location data viewing. It is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind and works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms.

We are constantly developing cool new things. Also this Wiki is getting more complete every day. Because the project is founded in the Netherlands, some documentation is still in Dutch. Our intention is to complete the Wiki with English documentation. Any help is appreciated!
